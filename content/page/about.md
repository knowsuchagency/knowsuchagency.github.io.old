Currently a software engineere [@kalo](https://kalohq.com/)

I served six years in the Navy as a Chinese linguist. During that time, I transitioned from translation work, to intelligence analysis, and finally to software development.

I have also been involved in HiCapacity, Code for Hawaii, and sfpython.

I besides software engineering, my other love is academic debate - particularly parliamentary debate.
