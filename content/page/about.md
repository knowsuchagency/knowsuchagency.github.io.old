When I'm not programming, I'm reading, exercising, or volunteering.

I served six years in the Navy as a Chinese linguist. During that time, I transitioned from translation work, to intelligence analysis, and finally to software development.

Co-Founder of PyHawaii, Hawaii's Python User Group.

I have also been involved in HiCapacity, Code for Hawaii, Code for San Francisco, Data for Democracy, and most recently, Alpha Beta Gamma - CCSF's business honor's society as its inter-council representative.


Feel free to say hello. I love meeting new people :)
