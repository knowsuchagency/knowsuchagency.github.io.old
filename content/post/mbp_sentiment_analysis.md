## What does Reddit think about the new MBP?
### Is it da bomb, or did it just bomb?
[**Run this notebook in binder**](http://mybinder.org:/repo/knowsuchagency/mpb-sentiment-analysis-example)

My friends and I have been talking today about Apple's announcement of their new Macbook Pro line.
I personally own an Apple TV, Ipad mini, Macbook Pro, and an iPhone. I was definitely looking forward
to see what Apple was going to come out with the new Macbook Pro line. My thoughts on the announcement aside,
it seemed to me like the overwhelming majority of users on Reddit [didn't come away very impressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/59plnp/lets_talk_about_those_prices/) with the announcements Apple made in regards to the new Macbook Pro. I thought this would be a good opportunity to play with Reddit's API and to try out some rudimentary sentiment analysis.


## Tech

To talk to Reddit, I'm using the aptly named, [**PRAW**](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library. PRAW stands for the Python Reddit Api Wrapper. Nice.

Now for the sentiment analysis, I'm going to use the [**TextBlob**](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) library. TextBlob is a library that provides an easy to use interface for a lot of common natural language processing tasks.

## Get the data

To begin, we instantiate praw's Reddit class with an appropriate user agent. Be careful how you define your user agent. Doing so incorrectly can get you banned according to Reddit. Fortunately, writing a user agent isn't hard at all. You can find the official documentation on how to do so on the [Reddit API wiki page](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API). 

As of this writing, the format should look something like this (taken from the aformentioned wiki):

    <platform>:<app ID>:<version string> (by /u/<reddit username>)

Example: 

    User-Agent: android:com.example.myredditapp:v1.2.3 (by /u/kemitche)



```python
import praw

# I saved my user agent string in a local file
# since one should use their own
with open('./.user_agent') as f:
    user_agent = f.read()

# instantiate Reddit connection class
r = praw.Reddit(user_agent=user_agent)

# let's get the current top 10 submissions
# since praw interacts with reddit lazily, we wrap the method
# call in a list
submissions = list(r.get_subreddit('apple').get_hot(limit=10))
[str(s) for s in submissions]
```




    ['375 :: Apple Keynote, October 2016 | Post-Event Megathread',

Cool, so we have some data. From looking at the actual subreddit in a browser, we can see the two top submissions are official threads so we'll just skip over them.

### Submission 1

We'll start by looking at the comments in the first submission about Apple's new pricing. Can you guess what people think?!

In praw, every Submission has a comments attribute which is iterable. This attribute isn't homogeneous. That is, some of the items will be Comment objects, and there may be a MoreComments class in there as well, so we'll need to handle that.


```python
# grab the first submission
submission = submissions[0]

# the actual text is in the body
# attribute of a Comment
def get_comments(submission, n=20):
    """
    Return a list of comments from a submission.
    
    We can't just use submission.comments, because some
    of those comments may be MoreComments classes and those don't
    have bodies.
    
    n is the number of comments we want to limit ourselves to
    from the submission.
    """
    count = 0
    def barf_comments(iterable=submission.comments):
        """
        This generator barfs out comments.
        
        Some comments seem not to have bodies, so we skip those.
        """
        nonlocal count
        for c in iterable:
            if hasattr(c, 'body') and count < n:
                count += 1
                yield c.body
            elif hasattr(c, '__iter__'):
                # handle MoreComments classes
                yield from barf_comments(c)
            else:
                # c was a Comment and did not have a body
                continue
    return barf_comments()
                
comments = list(get_comments(submission))
list(comments)
```

## Sentiment analysis!

So now we have the first twenty comments of the first submission.

We'll combine them into one piece of text and determine the overall sentiment from them.

According to the TextBlob docs, this is how to use their sentiment analysis api and how to interpret it


### The sentiment property returns a namedtuple of the form Sentiment(polarity, subjectivity). The polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.

```
>>> testimonial = TextBlob("Textblob is amazingly simple to use. What great fun!")
>>> testimonial.sentiment
Sentiment(polarity=0.39166666666666666, subjectivity=0.4357142857142857)
>>> testimonial.sentiment.polarity
0.39166666666666666
```


```python
from textblob import TextBlob

comment_blob = TextBlob(''.join(comments))
```




    Sentiment(polarity=-0.06283927712499143, subjectivity=0.5978612657184086)



Huh, things aren't looking good so far. Well, let's look at more data.


```python
more_comments = []
```


```python
for submission in submissions:
    more_comments.extend(get_comments(submission, 200))
```


```python
len(more_comments)
```




    404



I figure there are many more than 404 comments for those submissions. I suspect we only get that many because praw [tries to do the right thing](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/faq.html) and follow Reddit's guidelines for the amount of requests one can make within a given time limit. We're not going to worry about that now. 404 comments is good enough since we're only tinkering :)


```python
bigger_blob = TextBlob(''.join(more_comments))

# The first time I ran this method, it failed
# because I hadn't read TextBlob's docs closely
# and downloaded the corpus of text in needed.
# python -m textblob.download_corpora

print(len(bigger_blob.words))
```

    17046


Let's see what some of the most common words are


```python
from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(bigger_blob.words)

# the most common words are pretty mundane common parts of speech, so we'll skip the first few
counter.most_common()[60:100]
```




    [('no', 43),
     ('about', 42),
     ('has', 42),
     ('can', 39),
     ('there', 39),
     ('when', 38),
     ('from', 37),
     ('screen', 37),
     ('iPhone', 37),
     ('going', 37),
     ("'re", 36),
     ('Touch', 36),
     ('out', 35),
     ('even', 35),
     ('only', 34),
     ('15', 32),
     ('been', 32),
     ('too', 31),
     ('buy', 30),
     ('know', 30),
     ('we', 30),
     ('than', 30),
     ('up', 29),
     ('13', 29),
     ('people', 28),
     ('because', 28),
     ('time', 28),
     ('same', 27),
     ('They', 27),
     ('model', 27),
     ('which', 27),
     ('way', 26),
     ('other', 26),
     ('using', 26),
     ('prices', 26),
     ('still', 25),
     ('see', 25),
     ('by', 25),
     ('down', 25),
     ('Bar', 25)]



### Finally, let's see what the over all sentiment analysis is


```python
bigger_blob.sentiment
```




    Sentiment(polarity=0.07565960941292733, subjectivity=0.52062214346886)



We see that the overall sentiment is much more positive when we include a larger body of comments.

## In conclusion

We've hopefully learned a little more about communicating with Reddit using Python and doing some simple sentiment analysis on the content there. This wasn't meant to be a very scientific excercise, but I thought it was a fun way to play around with [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html). Both libraries are really powerful and simple to use and I can definitely see myself taking advantage of them a lot more in the future.
