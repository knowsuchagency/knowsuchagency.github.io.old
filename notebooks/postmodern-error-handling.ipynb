    "Using **Enums** and **NamedTuples** this way not only provides us with some welcome sanity checks, I think it makes the code much more readable and **testable**. I also really like the idea of having relatively simple data structures that define a finite set of possible states that we can create arbitrary constructors for outside of their class definitions, similar to other languages like Go. This isn't something new to Python, but recent developments in Python's syntax and its ecosystem make patterns like these much more useful and intuitive, in my opinion.\n",

    "Guido Van Rossum himself has said innovations in Python's type system is what has him most excited about the language moving forward, according to his [latest interview on TalkPython.fm](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/100/python-past-present-and-future-with-guido-van-rossum). The more I play around with these features and read about them, the more I see why."
